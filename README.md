This sample (incomplete) application is a node js server for a simple api for
 - creating users
 - login
 - logout (incomplete)
 - Creating articles
 - Retrieving articles (based on certain constraints)

//The app works on assumptions like 
-lodash and jwt node packages are installed, 
-authentication token is sent as an authorization header in every request.
-app.js, all necessary routes and middleware are already configured
